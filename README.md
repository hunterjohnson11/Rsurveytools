The purpose of Rsurveytools is to add a crosstab function that can make a table for multiple survey and demographic questions at the same time. It comes from the helpful code in this [Stack Overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71632242/create-multiple-cross-tables-with-one-line-code-function-with-gtsummary) with additional functionality added by me for convenience. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of Rsurveytools using the remotes package. 

``` r
remotes::install_github("hunterjohnson11/Rsurveytools")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:
